abstract="HOL(y)Hammer is an online AI/ATP service for formal (computer-understandable) mathematics encoded in the HOL Light system. The service allows its users to upload and automatically process an arbitrary formal development (project) based on HOL Light, and to attack arbitrary conjectures that use the concepts defined in some of the uploaded projects. For that, the service uses several automated reasoning systems combined with several premise selection methods trained on all the project proofs. The projects that are readily available on the server for such query answering include the recent versions of the Flyspeck, Multivariate Analysis and Complex Analysis libraries. The service runs on a 48-CPU server, currently employing in parallel for each task 7 AI/ATP combinations and 4 decision procedures that contribute to its overall performance. The system is also available for local installation by interested users, who can customize it for their own proof development. An Emacs interface allowing parallel asynchronous queries to the service is also provided. The overall structure of the service is outlined, problems that arise and their solutions are discussed, and an initial account of using the system is given.",

abstract="Sledgehammer is a component of the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant that integrates external automatic theorem provers (ATPs) to discharge interactive proof obligations. As a safeguard against bugs, the proofs found by the external provers are reconstructed in Isabelle. Reconstructing complex arguments involves translating them to Isabelle's Isar format, supplying suitable justifications for each step. Sledgehammer transforms the proofs by contradiction into direct proofs; it iteratively tests and compresses the output, resulting in simpler and faster proofs; and it supports a wide range of ATPs, including E, LEO-II, Satallax, SPASS, Vampire, veriT, Waldmeister, and Z3.",

   abstract = {A methodology for computer assisted proof is presented with an example. A central ingredient in the methods is the presentation of tactics (or strategies) in an algorithmic metalanguage. Further, the same language is also used to express combinators, by which simple elementary tactics -- which often correspond to the inference rules of the logic employed -- are combined into more complex tactics, which may even be strategies complete for a class of problems. However, the emphasis is not upon completeness but upon providing a metalogical framework within which a user may express his insight into proof methods and may delegate routine (but error-prone) work to the computer. This method of tactic composition is presented at the start of the paper in the form of an elementary theory of goal-seeking. A second ingredient of the methodology is the stratification of machine-assisted proof by an ancestry graph of applied theories, and the example illustrates this stratification. In the final section, some recent developments and applications of the method are cited.},

procedures when used as tactics for proving subgoals in a higher-order
logic interactive theorem prover. We first motivate why such
first-order proof tactics are useful, and then describe the core
integrating technology: an `LCF-style' logical kernel for clausal
first-order logic. This allows the choice of different logical
mappings between higher-order logic and first-order logic to be used
depending on the subgoal, and also enables several different
first-order proof procedures to cooperate on constructing the proof.
This work was carried out using the HOL4 theorem prover; we comment on
the ease of transferring the technology to other higher-order logic
theorem provers.}
